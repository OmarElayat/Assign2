Bitwise VHDL multiplier that displays the results on an SSD in BCD

The objectives of this project are:
-	RTL implementation of a 4x4 multiplier for unsigned numbers using combinational logic
-	RTL implementation of the conversion of binary numbers to binary-coded-decimal (BCD) encoder (binary to BCD conversion) using the "shift-add-3" algorithm
-	RTL implementation of the a seven-segment decoder (SSD) using combinational logic.
-	Integration of the above three blocks as shown in the figure below:

The RTL design targeting Altera Cyclone 5 5CEBA4F23C7N was successfully synthesized.

The HW implementation and validation of the integrated multiplier on the Terasic DE0-CV development board was successful.
